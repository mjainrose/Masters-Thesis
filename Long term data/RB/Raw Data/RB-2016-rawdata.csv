----INFO ON FIELDS---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Temp: water temperature measured in degrees Celsius (C),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpCond: specific conductivity measured in milli-Siemens per centimeter (mS/cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sal: salinity measured in parts per thousand (psu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DO_pct: dissolved oxygen measured in percent saturation (%),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DO_mgl: dissolved oxygen concentration measured in milligrams per Liter (mg/L),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Depth: sonde depth measured in meters (m),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cDepth: depth from a non-vented sensor corrected for changes in barometric pressure (m),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Level: sonde depth as referenced to a known vertical datum; NAVD88 measured in meters (m). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cLevel: level from a non-vented sensor corrected for changes in barometric pressure (m).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pH: pH measured in standard units,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turb: turbidity measured in either formazin nephelometric or nephelometric turbidity units (FNU/NTU) based on sensor; considered to be equivalent for SWMP purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ChlFluor: chlorophyll fluorescence measured in micrograms per Liter (ug/L) (optional SWMP supported parameter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Provisional Plus: A value of 0 in the provisional plus column indicates that the data have been through the automated flagging process (primary QAQC) ONLY and has not been checked by the Reserve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 While a value of 1 in the provisional plus column indicates that the data have been through some secondary QAQC at the Reserve using Excel macros (provided by the CDMO) to further QAQC the data. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
----FLAG CODES----,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each SWMP required parameter in the dataset is followed by a flag column (where the parameter header is preceded by a F_). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flag values are defined as:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-5         Outside high sensor range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-4         Outside low sensor range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-3         Data rejected due to QAQC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-2         Missing data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-1         Optional SWMP supported parameter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 0         Passed initial QAQC checks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 1         Suspect data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 2         Open - reserved for later flag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 3         Calculated data: non-vented depth/level sensor correction for changes in barometric pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 4         Historical data:  Pre-auto QAQC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 5         Corrected data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
